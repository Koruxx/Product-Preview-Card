## My process

- I started by writing the HTML for both cards. Then I started on the CSS for the mobile version, then for the desktop version. I found that the desktop version was harder than the mobile version. I hope that as I get better at web-dev I'll have a more purposeful work flow.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- Some important things that I learned was that I could make a border transparent to add a nice rounded effect on the container. Another things is that with flex, I can use the justify-content property to align items in the center of the element.

''
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
''

''
border: 0 solid transparent;
border-radius: 10px;
''

### Continued development

Just in general, I'd like to continue developing my skills in HTML and CSS before I jump into Javascript. I'd like to be a professional front-end dev, so I need to focus my appearance skills.

### Useful resources
